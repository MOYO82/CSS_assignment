            Technology makes lots of things easier, faster, and more accurate. 
            Technology is useful in almost every aspect of our lives. I am passionate about solving problems using technology, and this passion makes me want to learn so many things about technology. 
            I was a complete novice prior to October 2022, but with Stutern, I have learned a lot about software engineering in the last two months. 
            <b>I envision myself as a skilled backend developer by the end of this programme.</b></p>
